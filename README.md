Prototyping Programming Languages
=================================

Homework for a prototyping programming languages course where I had to write interpreters, transpilers,
and language extensions for functional, object oriented, and declarative languages.

Each of the following folders contains an index.html file
that shows the test cases and a browser based REPL to test code in.

func/ contains the files for an interpreter for an OCaml style functional language. 
The main interpreter file is func/interp.js

oo/ contains the files for a transpiler for a Smalltalk style oop language.
The main transpiler file is oo/trans.js

pm/ contains the files for a pattern matching extension for Javascript.
The main file is pm/match.js

log/ contains the files for a declarative extension for Javascript.
The main file is log/log.js
